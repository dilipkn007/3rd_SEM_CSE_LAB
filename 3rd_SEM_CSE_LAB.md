12. Given a File of N employee records with a set K of Keys (4-digit) which uniquely determine the records in file F. Assume that file F is maintained in memory by a Hash Table (HT) of m memory locations with L as the set of memory addresses (2-digit) of locations in HT. Let the keys in K and addresses in L are Integers. Design and develop a Program in C that uses Hash function H: K Â®L as H(K)=K mod m (remainder method), and implement hashing technique to map a given key K to the address space L.
